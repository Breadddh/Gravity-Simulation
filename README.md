# GRAVITY SIMULATION - INCLUDING TIME DILATION

Generates a black hole and simulates how points interact with it not only by gravitational acceleration, but also how time flows differently depending on distance.

Difference in time is shown visually by the points "dying" by decaying from white to black. To add a benchmark for "normal time", there is a line on the right edge of the window that decays at a constant rate "u_dc".
